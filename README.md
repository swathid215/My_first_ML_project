# # ðŸŽ“ My First Machine Learning Project


##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand the complete ML workflow:
- Importing and exploring data
- Cleaning and preprocessing datasets
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training a machine learning model
- Evaluating performance using accuracy and other metrics
- Comments are mentioned in each and every step for easy understanding

##  Dataset

The dataset used is **`placement.csv`**, which contains information about students such as:
- CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)  
- IQ score  
- Placement status  

*(These are examples â€” actual features depend on the dataset content.)*

##  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ for data handling  
- **NumPy** â€“ for numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ for ML modeling and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

##  Model Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and preparing features  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing feature relationships  
3. **Model Training:** Using a simple ML algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression / Decision Tree)  
4. **Model Evaluation:** Checking accuracy and testing predictions

##  Results

The model achieved a good balance between accuracy and interpretability.  
This project helped me learn:
- How to handle real datasets  
- How to train and test models  
- How to evaluate performance metrics

##  Key Learnings

- Basics of supervised machine learning  
- Understanding data preprocessing and feature selection  
- Hands-on experience with Python ML libraries  
- Building confidence for future, more complex ML projects
